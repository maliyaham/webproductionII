<p>A dynamic website that I like is Apple's website because of its UI design. This website is dynamic because they update their content frequently without needing to manually edit each individual HTML page. A dynamic website allows Apple to manage these updates efficiently using backend databases. </p>
<p> A static website that I like is Apple's website in 2006. This can be accessed through the Wayback Machine application. I like the website for the early 2000's nostalgia. This is an example of a static website because Apple could not personalize content for different users based on their preferences, location, and browsing history at the time.</p>
